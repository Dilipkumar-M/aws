Load balancer in ec2
--------------------
What is load balancing?

Can be 
	open source or
		nginx
		haproxy ect
	commercially available
		aws loadbalancers
		
	Distribute incoming traffic 
		to target (between group of) servers 
	Support traffic distribution algorithm
	Ability to add/remove servers to target group.
	be scalable
	
AWS Elastic load balancer (ELB) provides
	distribute traffic to 
		ec2 instances or
		other target types
	Instances can be multiple AZ's
	Elastic
		no single point of failure
	Internet facing or Internal
From a deployment perspective
	Highly resilient application deployment model
	Configurable traffic distribution options
	Canary deployment of application features and services
	Integrate 3rd party appliances & support identity provider integrations



Application Load balancer
	works at Layer 7: application layer
	supports http or https
	e.g. path based routing	
		https://customer/doSomething
		http://order/doSomething
	Loadbalancer
		listener1 (80) http
			rules on listener
			rules/algorithm can be configured.
			distribute traffic based on the rules
		listener2 (443) https
		
	ec2 instances
		can be distributed across multiple AZ's
		health check runs in target
		
	setup across atleast 2 AZ's
	Target can have
		symmetric or 
		assymetric 
			distribution of instances
		a microservice may have less instances while another has lot more.
		
		ALB can support cross zone load balancing
		
		Configure the /health url on the target group.
		Loadbalancer calls this end point to confirm that the node is healthy.
		Target may respond 200 for health and error for not being healthy.
		
		Back preassure
			dynamically route traffic to other healthy instances by potentially analyzing the congestion.
			i.e. a target can take itself out of service 
				(if the load is more ect)
			How? 
				Send an error message when the /health is called.
				Start sending 200 when things are back safe.
