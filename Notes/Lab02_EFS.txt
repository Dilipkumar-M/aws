Create EFS

	while creating the EFS, it gets connected to a VPC - Note this VPC
	this VPC should have inbound rules for ec2 instances.
	
		Search for security group (VPC feature)
		Pick the default Security group
			Ensure that inbound rules includes the id of the current security group 
				(e.g. sg-e9af1f91)
			Add my ip also into it.
			
			

Create 2 Amazon ec2 instance because nfs utils are installed by default in it.
	(installation of nfs fails on centos).
		Add to the default security group. 
		
	Create EFS attached to the same default security group.
	Ensure that EC2 instances has an inbound rule allowing the IP range of EFS
		e.g. 172.31.0.0/16
