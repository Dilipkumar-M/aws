Cloud Service Models
--------------------
IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
	rent out virtual infrastructure
		servers
		networking
		dns
			Domain name service
		firewall
	highest of 
		freedom 
		flexiblity
	control 
	similar to existing IT hardware
		
PaaS (Platform as a service)
	infrastructure maintained by the cloud provider
	manage and configure a platform 
		customers to use
	don't need to maintain the hardware
	customer
		resource procurement
		hardware maintainance
		capacity planning
		patching
		
		reduces heavy lifting
	AWS Elastic beanstalk
		artifacts
			.war, .jar, gem, .soln
	Force.com
	Openshift
	
SaaS (Software as a service)
	customer
		gets a complete software
		
all cloud access it through 
	browser
	cli (command line interface)
	api 
	
	IaC (Infrastructure as Cod)
		Infrastructure provisioning tools
			Terraform
			Cloudformation
		Configuration management
			Ansible 
			Puppet
			Chef
	
Cloud computing deployment models
---------------------------------
	Public cloud
		anybody can access
		arguably less secured
		over the internet
			to 
				general public
				or industries
		access it easily
		getting instances/service are easy
			subscription 
		Advantages of Public cloud
			ease of access
			available to wider audience
				websites
			minimal investment
			Low/No setup 
			No infrastructure management : cloud provider
			No maintenance required
			Dynamic scale
		Dis advantages of Public cloud
			Less secured/Higher chance of hacking
			May have less performance
			Low customization 
			
			
	Private cloud
		accessible only to a single customer
			one-to-one environment
			no sharing of resources
			entire cloud is within your boundary
				not accessible to others
		Cloud platform 
			implemented in a cloud-based secure environment
			protected using 
				vpn's
				firewalls
			supervised by a network or security engineer
			great flexibility 
				customize 
		
		Advantages
			sole owner
			better control
			complete control
				service integration/replacement
				IT operations
				policies and customer behaviour
			Data security 
				critical services may use private cloud
				segment resources
					improve 
						performance
						access
			Much better in security
			Integrate with legacy application
		Disadanvantages
			Cost 
				people 
				infrastructure
			maintance 
				by the customer
			less scalable
			may need to have certain software to access
				e.g. vpn
				ide 
				
	Hybrid cloud
		bridge/combination 
			public and 
			private
		generally 
			get best of both 
		move data between cloud provider solutions
		Advantages
			Adv. of both
				accessibblity of servies to public
			cost 
				if using public for hosting
			security 	
		disadv.
			difficult to manage 
			slow data tranission 
			cost
	Community cloud
		multiple tenants are sharing a platform 
			distributed sytem
		Advantages
			cost 
			reporting
				under one big cloud is
				share 
					resources 
					best practices
					solutions
			security
			maintanance 
		Disadvantage
			complicated
			initial invest can be high
			many times you are the first person (torch bearers)
				costly 
				security challenges
			difficult to hunt
			rigid in customization 
	Multi-cloud
		use multiple cloud providers
			generally for 
				redundancy 
				reliability
		utilize best of both/all the providers
		Advantages
			utilize best
			reduce vendor lock in.
			high availability 
			flexible
			reduced latency
				services from multiple clouds
					belong to same region
		Disadvantages
			complexity
			cost
			cloud provider specific
			security
	
AWS specific advantages

AWS IAM (Identity access managment)
-----------------------------------
	web service
	centrally manage permissions
	iam control
		authentication 
			who the user?
			credentials
				user-id, password
				access key, secret key
				federation
		authorization
			do yo have the permission?
			data is maintained aws
	root
		complete authority
		keep it safe
		don't use it for normal operations
		create a new user
		
	User
	Groups
	Policies
	Roles
	
IAM features

	(default: no access to anything)
	if explicit deny
		deny access
		no explicit deny
			if policy allows
				SCP (boundary)

6 different types of policies
	identity based policies
		grant permssions to 
			user
			group
			roles
			
			group 
				s3
				ec2
				
				aws-managed policies
				customer-manager policies
				
	resource based policies
		policies attached a resource 
	permission boundaries
		define a permission boundary 
			for an IAM entity
				user/group/role
		do not define 
			maximum permission that a resource based policy to an entity
			
	Organization SCP
		maximum permissions
			each account member 
				in the organization unit would get
	ACL's
		what principals
			in other account can access 
				in the host account 
		doesn't use json 
		
	session policies
		Pass advanced session policies
			cli or api 
			what permission can be granted to a particular sessions
			
			
api mode of operation
---------------------
	two modes
		standalone context 
		organization context
	
	standalone	
		user permission or role permissions
			modify attributes 
			automatically account id

Access Advisor
--------------
	Track for security 
	auditing of activities done by a user
	what user, resouces and policies were accessed by the user
	
Best practices IAM
-------------------
1. Root user 
	don't use them as much as possible 
	don't enable secret and access for root user
	enable MFA root user
		root account: cannot restrict
Normal user
	give min. permissions required
	don't give programmatic access if not required
	don't generate access keys if not required
	never share access keys
	enable MFA
	create user for individual user
	create admin. user 
		give all admin permission
		
	groups
		min. permission 
		define boundaries 
		deny roles
		create policies and roles appropriately
		
	
IP Address: routable address over IP network
		IP network : any network which follows ip protocol
		
	
Private IP
	recognize internally
	can't under over the internet
	dedicated IP
	get this from subnet cidr (range in subnet)
	defined in RFC 1918 addresses
	[0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255]
		localhost: 127.0.0.1
	
	private ip
		ec2
		range in subnet
		vpc
	accessible within it's own vpc
	
Public IP
	like mobile number/passport number
	people all over the world 
		can identify
	can change
	routable 
	accessible over the internet
	stop and start 
		get a diff. ip address
		
Elastic IP
	stop and start 
		get the same address
	independent resource	
	can be disassocated from ec2
	belongs an account 
	range for elastic ip that you create:5
	

Security boundary
-----------------
	Big concern in cloud world
	Data is handled by cloud provider
		assume it is encrypted.
		we handle data 
			we should encrypt
			accessible only through
				proxy 
				broker
					define boundaries
						incoming requests 
						outgoing requests
						
			
		CSA (Cloud security alliance)
		-----------------------------
		Iaas
			most basic level of service
		Paas
			provides platform 
				cloud provider may provide services
		SaaS
			high 
				responsibility reduces
				
		Data should secured
			motion
				with in cloud premises
				outside
			rest
				storage
					with in cloud
					client 
						(mobile)
						web
							jwt 
	Take care of 
		Access control
			authentication 
			authorization 
				cookies
				tokens
				certificates
				credentials
					etc.
		auditing
		
Isolated access data
	data stored cloud
		should not be directly access to external world
			proxy 
			brokers
			
			
	Always implement layered security


Advantages of moving cloud
--------------------------
1. Responsibility of managing and maintaing good part of our service can be moved to cloud providers
	Industry standards solutions
2. On-demand service 
3. Lower upfront investment 
	less risk taken by business
4. Resource pooling 
	sharing cost, 
		cost of security
5. Pay-per-user pricing 
6. Measured services
	track, monitor
7. Security
	bastion host 
	firewalls
	
8. Broad network access
	easy to setup
9. Global access
	you can access globally
	create services globally
10. Flexibility
